Task: 
Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

Procedure:
Used Pillow (PIL) for pixel-level access
XOR operation applied to RGB values for encryption
Symmetric encryption (same key used for decryption)
Encrypted and restored image successfully
